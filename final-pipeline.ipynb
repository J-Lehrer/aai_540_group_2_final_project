    "Amazon SageMaker Pipelines offers machine learning (ML) application developers and operations engineers the ability to orchestrate SageMaker jobs and author reproducible ML pipelines. It also enables them to deploy custom-built models for inference in real-time with low latency, run offline inferences with Batch Transform, and track lineage of artifacts. They can institute sound operational practices in deploying and monitoring production workflows, deploying model artifacts, and tracking artifact lineage through a simple interface, adhering to safety and best practice paradigms for ML application development.\n",

    "* Training job steps - An iterative process that teaches a model to make predictions by presenting examples from a training dataset.\n",

    "* Create model steps - A step that creates a model for use in transform steps or later publication as an endpoint.\n",
    "* Transform job steps - A batch transform to preprocess datasets to remove noise or bias that interferes with training or inference from a dataset, get inferences from large datasets, and run inference when a persistent endpoint is not needed.\n",

However, to obtain this number requires cutting the shell through the cone, staining the section, and counting the number of rings through a microscope, which is a time-consuming task.
